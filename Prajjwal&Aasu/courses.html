                    management of software as well as hardware processes. A computer engineer is the one who specializes
                    in computation theory and computational system designs.

                    Computer engineering is a blend of Information Technology, Electrical & Electronics Engineering,
                    Hardware & Software Design, etc. The computer engineers have major involvement in the development of
                    software and hardware systems.

                    electricity, electronics and electromagnetism. Trained electrical engineers design electric circuits
                    and equipment. They work on large power plants as well in small hardware companies which includes
                    designing, manufacturing and operating power plants, industrial machinery,
                    computer chips and ignition systems for automobiles and all kinds of
                    engines.

                    However, the
                    actual design, construction and manufacturing of useful devices and systems began with the
                    implementation of Michael Faraday's Law of Induction, which essentially states that the voltage in a
                    circuit is proportional to the rate of change in the magnetic field through the circuit. This law
                    applies to the basic principles of the electric generator, the electric motor and the transformer.
                    The advent of the modern age is marked by the introduction of electricity to homes, businesses and
                    industry, all of which were made possible by electrical engineers.

                    management of the project's schedule, cost, quality, safety, scope, and function. Construction
                    management is compatible with all project delivery methods. No matter the setting, a Construction

                    Construction Project Management (CPM) is the overall planning, coordination, and control of a
                    project from beginning to completion. CPM is directed at meeting a client’s requirements to produce
                    a functionally and economically viable project.
                    In construction management, a construction manager will supervise and manage contractors and
                    laborers at construction sites. From time to time, they meet and discuss projects with architects,
                    specialized trade employees, and civil engineers on projects or upcoming builds. They are
                    responsible for addressing emergencies, work delays, or any other problems that affect the
                    construction project.
